A personal mashup of the altspace video jukebox for web use.

It simply loads the control panel and the viewer into one page.
I may epand this later with some tweaks to make it behave better.

Known issues:
-doesnt work on iOS at all
-works best in firefox, sometimes stops playing in chrome
-will often not auto-advance as it doesnt see any altspace users connected to the instance. Use Vote to skip to force it to.
